##Beginners luck

If like me you are just beginning with Github, on windows, here is what I do.

(insert instructions on making a repo here... usually a new user is guided through this step)

Once the git is made, navigate back to github.com at your leisure. I haven't had much luck with the Git for windows client yet, because it involves learning special commands.

On the right hand side of your homepage after you log in is a list of your repos. Click on the repo you made.

Once in the repo, look under the Files tag; there is a little plus sign. Click on that. Now you have a new file. Click on soft wrap on the right hand drop down menu. Now you can begin editing your file following Markdown rules. I recommend putting a title on your first line like this:

## Title

it looks like this in markdown:
`## Title`

When you are done, copy the title of your file. Click on the "name your file" box at the top and paste in your filename. Add a ".md" extension. Clickk on the button at the bottom named "Commit new file" 

Click on the Files tab again, and it will give you a list of files in your repo.

You are done!
