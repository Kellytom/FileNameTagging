##Beginners luck

If like me you are just beginning with Github, on windows, here is what I do. This is the bare minimum.

(insert instructions on making a repo here... usually a new user is guided through this step)

Once the git is made, navigate back to github.com at your leisure. I haven't had much luck with the Git for windows client yet, because it involves learning special commands.

On the right hand side of your homepage after you log in is a list of your repos. Click on the repo you made.

Once in the repo, look under the Files tag; there is a little plus sign. Click on that. Now you have a new file. Click on soft wrap on the right hand drop down menu. Now you can begin editing your file following Markdown rules. I recommend putting a title on your first line like this:

## Title

it looks like this in markdown:
`## Title`

When you are done, copy the title of your file. Click on the "name your file" box at the top and paste in your filename. Add a ".md" extension. Click on the button at the bottom named "Commit new file" 

Click on the Files tab again, and it will give you a list of files in your repo. Click on your file to see what it looks like. You can also edit it and commit it again. There is an edit button on the top right side. There is a preview button on the top left of the editing screen. I like the zen editing mode (the button looks like a picture frame on the top left hand side of the file.

#### What files should I make?

I recommend doing the readme.md file first because it shows up as soon as someone comes to your repo.

#### You are done!
