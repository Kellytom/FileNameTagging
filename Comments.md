 I am just an amateur hacker, so any robust programming will have to be done by someone else. I will pursue some simple ideas in python, pythonista, and perhaps visual basic. Please feel free to contribute to these comments.

#### Form of the tags
##### Feb 22 2013
I thought about the best way to format the tags. The form I came up with is "filename tag- tag-.extension" Other forms could be "filename -tag -tag.extension" or "filename -tag- -tag-.extension".

The reason I chose "tag-" is because a program could identify files that are tagged because the last character is "-". Filenames that don't have tags would not be sorted. "-tag-" could work as well but it takes many characters and some filenames might be limited in length.
